# dremio-stress

Simple tool to stress dremio via ODBC and REST interfaces

## Via the REST interface

    bash```
    ```

## Via ODBC 

NOTE: I HIGHLY suggest using the docker image to run this which already has unixODBC included and therefore will run on anything including the M series Mac with minimal fuss.

### Via Docker

    bash```
    ```

### Directly

    bash```
    ```



## Help
